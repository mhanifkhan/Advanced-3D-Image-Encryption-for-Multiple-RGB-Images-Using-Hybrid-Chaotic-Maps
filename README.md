## Overview
This work introduces a multiple RGB image encryption scheme based on **chaotic maps** and **3D row/column swapping operations**.  

### Key Features
- Construction of a **3D RGB image** from multiple input images.  
- Confusion achieved by random **row/column swapping** across stacked images.  
- Diffusion achieved using keystreams generated from **Intertwining Logistic Map (ILM)** and **Improved Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (MPWLCM)**.  
- Integration of **SHA-256 hash** and a **256-bit user key** for enhanced security and plaintext sensitivity.  
- Robustness against brute-force, statistical, and differential attacks.  

This scheme offers a strong solution for secure storage and transmission of digital images.

## Requirements
- MATLAB **R2023a** (or later)  
- Image Processing Toolbox  

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `code/` folder.  
3. Run the demo script:

```matlab
>> demo
```

This will:
- Encrypt the sample images in `data/`  
- Save encrypted images in `results/`  
- Decrypt them back to verify correctness  

---

## Repository Structure
- `code/` — MATLAB implementation (`encrypt.m`, `decrypt.m`, `utils.m`, `demo.m`)  
- `data/` — Sample RGB images used for testing  
- `results/` — Encrypted and decrypted outputs generated by `demo.m`  
- `README.md` — Documentation file  
- `LICENSE` — License file (default: MIT)  

---

## Results
Running the demo will reproduce the following:
- Example **encrypted images**  
- Example **decrypted images** identical to the originals  
- (Optional) Security validation metrics such as histogram, entropy, and correlation
